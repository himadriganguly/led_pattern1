# LED TWO WAY PATTERN LIGHT

This is just a practice project to create some pattern using led and arduino board. Here is the code and the breadboard settings. Here the pattern will move from right to left and left to right. Also the speed of the pattern is random. 

All the diagrams are designed using `Fritzing`

You can download the project from Github - [**https://github.com/himadriganguly/led_pattern1**] (https://github.com/himadriganguly/led_pattern1)

## Requirements

1. 5 LED iof any colour
2. Breadboard
3. Arduino Uno
4. Fritzing [**http://fritzing.org/**] (http://fritzing.org/)
